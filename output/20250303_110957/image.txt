The image depicts a person sitting on a chair adorned with a white, lace-like fabric. The individual is wearing a sheer, light-colored dress that appears to be made of a silky material, giving it a reflective and delicate appearance. The person's legs are crossed, and they are wearing long, white stockings or tights. Their feet are bare, and there are several flowers placed around them, including large pink and red blooms and smaller purple ones.

In the background, there is a table covered with a similar white, lace-like cloth. On the table, there are several lit candles in candlesticks, adding a soft, warm glow to the scene. The overall setting has a dark, almost black backdrop, which contrasts sharply with the light colors of the dress, flowers, and candles, creating a dramatic and somewhat ethereal atmosphere. The person's hair is styled in loose waves, and they have a serene, almost melancholic expression on their face.
